# SLAM Algorithms

Here I intend to implement mapping and localization algorithms related to SLAM. First I'll do it in Python, then I'll switch to C++. The objective is to have a solid understanding of them and have a working robot that I can improve with time. Should not be perfect or extremly fast, the only intention is to learn.
